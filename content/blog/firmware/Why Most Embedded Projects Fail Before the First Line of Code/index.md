Writing code is only half the job in embedded systems.  
The other half — the _critical half_ — is the system design you do before you even open your editor.

After 3 years in AIoT Space, I’ve experienced the same across projects. Developers jump straight into coding, hack everything into `main()`, and only realize the real problems when devices start failing in the field. By then, the cost of fixing is 10x higher or just not feasible.

Here’s what I’ve learned the hard way:

### 1. Define System Requirements & Power Constraints Upfront
Your firmware doesn’t live in a vacuum. It lives inside a device that runs on a battery, solar panel, or power supply with strict limits.  
If you don’t know your power budget and performance requirements from day one, you’re already flying blind.

### 2. Design a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
Stop wiring your application logic directly to GPIOs, ADCs, and UARTs.  
Without a HAL, every hardware change means rewriting your application. With a HAL, hardware swaps are just configuration updates. It’s the difference between scalable firmware and one-off prototypes.

### 3. Implement Power Profiling from Day One
Power isn’t an afterthought. Every function call, every peripheral you enable, and every polling loop consumes energy.  
If you only start profiling power after the product is built, it’s already too late.

### 4. Build Modular, Testable Code Architecture

Monolithic `main()` functions with hardcoded dependencies are the fastest way to kill maintainability.  
Instead, build firmware as modular components: drivers, services, application logic. Add hooks for unit tests and simulation. That’s how you catch bugs early — not when devices are already in the field.

### 5. Stop Writing Code That Assumes Everything Works
Hardware fails, Sensors return garbage values, Wi-Fi disconnects, Power drops mid-operation.
If your firmware doesn’t have proper error handling and recovery, you’re not building a system — **you’re gambling**.

### The Reality Check
> Firmware is not just code to make hardware <span class="animated-text">blink</span>.
It’s the bridge between silicon and user experience. Get it wrong, and the entire product fails — no matter how good your PCB, enclosure, or cloud stack is.

So the next time you’re about to open your editor and start coding, stop and ask yourself: _`Am I designing a system, or just writing code?`_
